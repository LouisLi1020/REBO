# Setup status

Initial setup is **done**: platforms generated, repo connected to GitHub, first push to `main` completed.

- **Run the app:** see [README.md](README.md) — `flutter pub get` then `flutter run`.
- **Add button sound:** put `click.mp3` in `assets/audio/`.
- **Daily workflow:** develop and push from this `app/` directory only.
